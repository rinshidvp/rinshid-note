## Bringing the information together

I built the portal to give applicants one place to explore cutoff information, find answer keys and events, and reach a department help desk. Each resource has its own section so visitors can start with the question they have.

TanStack Start and React provide the interface, while Supabase stores the reference information. An administration area supports maintaining the resources. The predictor helps people explore historical cutoffs; official admissions sources remain the place to check current rules and decisions.
